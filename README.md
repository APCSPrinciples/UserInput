User Input
==========

In this assignment you will write a program that takes user input from both the keyboard and mouse to allow the user to interact with your program. What your program does with that input is entirely up to you. For example, you could create an etch-a-sketch, a drawing program, a color mixer, a game or any program of your choosing that uses both mouse and keyboard input. Have fun and be creative.

Program Requirements
--------------------
+ Your finished program will need at least two function definitions:   
  + `def setup()`    
  + `def draw()`   
+ It will also need to respond to both keyboard and mouse input.
